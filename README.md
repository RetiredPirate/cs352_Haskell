# cs352_Haskell

Project 1 for cs352 Programming Languages:
Haskell program that takes a list of game results, groups results by team 
  and prints a list of standings for each team. exec() prints to the console
  and exec2() writes to a file called output.txt. Both read from a file 
  called input.txt.
